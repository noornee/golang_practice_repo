this directory basically contains folders with executables that mimic actual linux commands

e.g. ```echo``` command in linux is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument


to mimic what ```echo``` does, navigate to the **echo** directory and run ```go build``` 
after the executable is built, run ```./echo <string> ```
